Allows to:
1. serialise/deserialise BHoMObjects and Push/Pull them to/from JSON files;

2. manage File/Directory objects:
  - pull files residing on a FileSystem 
  - access their properties (date modified, author, etc)
  - sort them by properties
  - query files by filenames using `*` Wildcards
  - push batches of JSON files as per point 1.
